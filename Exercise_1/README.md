After installing the CLI, follwo these steps to configure and set up the CLI to use

1. Log in to Confluent Cloud:

confluent login --save

It will take you to a browser to Allow access. The --save flag stores credentials locally to reduce repeated logins

Run command "confluent environment list" and youâ€™ll likely see only one environment. Note the ID.

2. Set environment:

```sh
confluent environment use {ID}
```

3. List Kafka Clusters

```sh
confluent kafka cluster list
```

4. Set the Kafka cluster to use

```sh
confluent kafka cluster use {ID}
```

5. Create and apply an API key for the CLI to communicate with the Kafka cluster:

```sh
confluent api-key create --resource {ID}
```

6. Save the key and secret somewhere safe. Then run:

```sh
confluent api-key use {API Key} --resource {ID}
```

Your CLI is now fully set up.
